# Real time private chatting app using React, Golang and mongodb

As the title reads, This app is private chat application built using React (version 16.13.1). This react application is built using functional components only, so You won't find `setState`. Here I have React Hooks to update the components and for React life cycles.
Server-side is written in Golang (version 1.13.8) and MongoDB(version 3.6.3).

This project was generated with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) version 2.1.8.
